/*
ℹ️ Points to remember
Thread 1 acquires a lock an account A and then sleeps, giving
Thread 2 time to acquire a lock on Account B
Thread 1 Waits for account A & Thread 2 waits for Account B.
Since neither thread releases the lock,both keep waiting for each
other creating a DEADLOCK ❌🔒 Situation
✅Deadlock Explanation : Deadlock occurs when each thread is holding a resource waiting for the other thread to release it
 ➡️When deadlock occurs, it will not destroy the app, it will freeze it permanently
 🟢 How to resolve the deadlock --> Write better code!
